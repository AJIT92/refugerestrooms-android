# Bare bones of an Android client for www.refugerestrooms.org

The app opens as MainActivity, from whence you can either add a restroom or perform a search.

## Getting started
You can use Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) to build this project, and it should behave like any other android studio project.

Clone the repo here and the in Android Studio go to File -> New -> Import Project and navigate to your clone.

## TODO
* Show all results on map
* Search flags (e.g. accessible, unisex)
